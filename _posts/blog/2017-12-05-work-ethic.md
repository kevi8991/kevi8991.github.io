## "Your potential could be nothing. But nothing is better than where you are now, which is _stuck_."

Lately, I've been struggling with getting myself to the piano to practice. Also, I've been having difficulty getting myself to the computer to write up my papers... and sometimes, I just don't feel like getting out of bed.

Anyway, I obviously have issues with procrastination; this is simply a fact of life. But I also have an odd tendency to binge on one of my commitments or hobbies while ignoring all of my other responsibilities for extended periods of time--and now it's time to stop editing my blog and get back to work.
