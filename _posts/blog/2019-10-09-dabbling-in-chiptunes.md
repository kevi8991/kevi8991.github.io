Some more stuff from my  _Introduction to Video Game Music_ class, with a bit of a story behind it this time.

This may be old news for some of y'all, but here goes. There's this guy on YouTube called [heiakim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnTB8uNxND40iwvPiyzpnWw) who makes music videos based on highly esoteric motifs--think samples from anime openings, Google Translate, etc. Case in point:

Having hit a bit of a rut, I asked my friends for a five-word sentence to use as a motif, and got **I found a big banana**(ha). Running that through [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=en&tl=ja&text=i%20found%20a%20big%20banana), I came up with a little motif, and fleshed out the rest of the song around that. You can hear it below:
