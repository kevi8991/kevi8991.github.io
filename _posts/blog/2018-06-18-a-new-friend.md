A month after my tragic loss of Mikey II, I finally picked up a new ride!

Fixed-gear, hot pink, made-in-Toronto goodness. Apparently, only two of the pink frames have ever been sold, so I'm sure I'll have an easy time tracking this baby down if it ever gets stolen. Thank you [BoneSquad Bicycles](https://www.facebook.com/bonesquadbicycles/) for the great deal and fantastic service!!

Also, RIP Yimeng's bike :(
