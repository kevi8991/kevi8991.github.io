##13
You're a teenager!

##14
High school. Need I say more?

##15
You're kinda uncool. Like, you're not quite as insufferable as you were when you were 13, but you're still pretty damn annoying. **You also dress like a dork.**

##16
Things kinda shape up a bit. You can drive in the States, and you can apply for your G1. **I have yet to do that and will get on it eventually.**

##17
Broadly uninteresting. Maybe you've decided to clean up your wardrobe. Some amount of disposable income, if you've figured out school enough to get a part time job on the side.

##18
The big one. You're probably graduating high school, and you can drink in most parts of the world. **Except most of Canada and the States.**

##19
The big one if you live in Canada. Drinking age, 1st year of university.

##20
You've finally escaped the scourge that is the teens. Your loved ones will thank you.

##21
Legal drinking age in the States, but you're probably already drinking. Definitely a milestone in terms of independence.

##22
Thanks Taylor.

##23
Crap, you're out of school and don't know what to do with the rest of your life. You are officially in your mid-twenties. **Quarter-life crisis ensues.**

I was sloshed for my quarantine birthday but my roommate and her girlfriend made me cake and drinks so I really can't complain.
