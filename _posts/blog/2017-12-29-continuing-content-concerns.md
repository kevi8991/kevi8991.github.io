First post of 2018--Happy New Year :D

So I've been making vague attempts at blogging for about a month now, and I've put some more thought into what I'm _actually_ going to be writing about on here.

For starters, I'm definitely going to keep updating my [Travelogue](/travelogue/). I have a massive backlog of photos from my travels, including a couple thousand from Europe I haven't bothered sifting through yet. I've always been into the idea of documenting the things I've done and places I've been, but I don't have the patience for scrapbooking, so I guess blogging is the next best thing!

I'm also aiming to write another couple of posts in the [Theatrical Micing](/audio/) series this month. I wanted to write up an introduction to the micing of bands, but realized while trying to do so that I don't have a pit to take photos of. So I've shelved that idea for now, and I've started writing up some guidelines for marking up scripts for live mixing.

For the rest of the blog, I might start writing a bit about film cameras and cute cafes... seems like most of the content up here right now is about blogging struggles, so I should break out of this meta-posting and start actually blogging!

Anyway, that's all I have to say for now. Best wishes for the start of 2018 <3
