## "You have to say no to some things to say yes to other things, period. There are only 24 hours in a day."

Brian McDonagh, my piano professor, alternates between intellectually stimulating and incredibly vapid every lesson I have with him. It's fascinating, really--he seems to have a lot of well-philosophized ideas floating around in his mind, while also musing about whatever he sees on the news or on TV for far too long. He's convinced that dryers are portals to a dimension that we cannot perceive, and that it's the reason socks keep disappearing from the laundry.

In any case, "There are only 24 hours in a day" is a phrase I've heard a lot from him, and for good reason--I have a lot of trouble turning people or things down. While Brian has accepted that school will likely never be my top priority, he maintains that I need to be far more diligent about prioritizing my commitments. "You're paying thousands of dollars annually to be in school, so at least make the most of it!"

There are only so many things that any one person can do. For better or for worse, there are only 24 hours in a day. So pick and choose with great care where you want to spend your time, and don't be afraid to say no to whatever doesn't make the cut.
