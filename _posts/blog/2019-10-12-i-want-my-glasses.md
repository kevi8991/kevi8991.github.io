So I have multiple pairs of glasses, right?

Y'know, got the normal, nice-looking pair, plus the beater (spare) pair for the gym or in case something unfortunate happens to my main pair. Then there are the fun ones--a pair of GUNNARs for gaming, and a pair of prescription sunglasses bc why not. Point is, I have four pairs of glasses that I regularly use.

Here's the problem: I never put the glasses I'm wearing in a logical, convenient spot, and I'm too stubborn to use _any of the other three pairs_ to find them.

Stupid, right? I know. But think about it--it's just so easy to throw your glasses on the bed and take a quick snooze. Or just toss em on the couch while taking off your pullover. Or on the counter in the kitchen while frying a steak.

Like, am I the only one who takes off my glasses 10-30 times a day? Surely not.

## But I'm probably the only one stubborn enough not to use _my other glasses to find them_.
