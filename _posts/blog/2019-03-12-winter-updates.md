AND WE'RE BACK! I suppose my readership is negligible, but I do enjoy putting things on here regardless. In as close an order as possible to my [summer updates](/blog/summer-updates/):

- Still haven't named my [bike](/blog/a-new-friend/), but Pinkie and Mikey III are contenders. It hasn't seen much use since October, but that's okay
- [If/Then](https://www.facebook.com/events/321126918535838/?event_time_id=321126921869171) is actually happening, and I'm honestly so stoked! The cast is lovely, the band is phenomenal, and I'm excited--albeit a bit terrified--to show everyone what's been cooking!
- My duties as [The Cat's Eye](https://thecatseye.ca) Technical Director continue. Most recently, I facilitated the SMC Troubadors' remount of [Shreya Jha's](https://www.facebook.com/shreya.jha.332) original musical [Statistics](https://www.facebook.com/events/2340462299547502). Programming a show in an hour is never ideal, but I'm proud of the work I did, as well as what the space is capable of now
- [VicXposure](http://vicxposure.ca) is hunkering down and getting ready to shoot this year's [Highball](https://www.facebook.com/events/626599581129499/)
- Our--[Nam Nguyen](https://www.facebook.com/nam.nguyen.545) of [A Perfect Bowl of Pho](http://paprikafestival.com/festival-2018/perfectpho/) fame and [Cy Macikunas](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009293827815)--fledgling theatre company Hotake has now successfully produced three shows, and hosted a fourth! David Henry Hwang's [Yellow Face](https://www.facebook.com/events/251274349075242/), directed by Sai Macikunas; Nam Nguyen's [A Perfect Bowl of Pho](https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/stage/review/2019/01/25/vietnamese-canadian-double-bill-of-fine-china-and-a-perfect-bowl-of-pho-offers-a-blast-of-fresh-ideas.html), directed by Gianni Sallese and music directed by Kevin Vuong; and [An Other Tries To Speak](https://www.facebook.com/events/236129450595830/), a collection of short plays directed by Maya Wong
- Still unemployed :c
