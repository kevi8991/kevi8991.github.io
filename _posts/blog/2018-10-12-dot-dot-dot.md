I'm not quite sure where I started seeing this, but it was earlier this year, basically everywhere on Facebook.

Especially my mom.

Love you, mom. But please stop.

Now, I know, like, we millenials, y'know, kinda talk, like, a bit like this. Sometimes. Uh, yeah.

However, I find... this... sortof thing... almost... just as bad...

Turns out there are quite a few [articles](https://theoutline.com/post/3333/why-do-old-people-text-like-this-an-investigation) about this phenomenon as well. The general consensus is that old folx want to avoid being misinterpreted as negative or condescending, which I do suppose makes a good deal of sense. Full stops and/or exclamation points can read as a bit passive-aggresive at times, whereas the humble ellipsis is... a bit more open ended...? I'm not quite sure, but I think that's about right.

Conversely, I feel as though I've been swearing a lot lately. My catchphrase this month has been _fuck that shit_, in any context, at any time of day. So maybe I should dial back on that.

Hope everyone... had a good Thanksgiving... ;)
