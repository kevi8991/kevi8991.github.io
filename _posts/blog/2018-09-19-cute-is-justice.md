I'm currently working on [Heathers: The Musical](http://harthouse.ca/heathers-the-musical/) at [Hart House Theatre](http://harthouse.ca/hart-house-theatre/) as a volunteer RF technician, as well as a substitute keys player. Basically, I work really hard for half an hour, sit around until I'm needed for a few hours, work really hard for another half hour, before finally cleaning up and going home.

It's a great gig, and I'm learning a lot, but it's also very boring. I've been doing readings and organizing my life during the free time I have. However, I'm writing this mostly because I'm consistently impressed by the fantastic attitude that Tim Davidson, House Technician of Hart House Theatre, carries himself with.

Adorable, right?

Tim and I have this habit of putting up pictures of cute animals on the computer monitor in the crew room, which is where all the micing happens. Actors come by all the time, so these adorable images serve as both morale boosters and conversation starters.

Sometimes you just need a little pick-me-up after a flubbed line, and other times you just like looking at cute pictures of adorable animals! Either way, it's our fun little way of breaking down that divide between cast and crew, and maintaining a positive attitude backstage.

Which brings me back to Tim. I can't say he always keeps his cool--which is fair, given the decrepit state of Hart House theatre--but he always carries himself in a way that's sure to put a smile on your face. He's professional, sociable, and cracks the worst jokes at the best times.

I'm just coming off a very busy week, so I really owe it to Tim for making volunteering at Hart House something to look forward to. I sure hope these cute pictures brightened up your days, too!
