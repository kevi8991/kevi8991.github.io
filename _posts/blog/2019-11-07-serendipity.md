## the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.

like running into your best friend after mentioning their name in a conversation,

or a classmate passing by while you're stumped on an assignment;

thinking (and saying!) exactly what the person you're talking to was thinking,

or perhaps reading about something you dreamed of the night before;

maybe finding some nostalgic souvenir while you're cleaning,

or hearing from someone you've been thinking of reaching out to.

whatever it may be, treasure those moments--they're far and few between c:
