So this is my 21st birthday! Wow, I feel old.

But am I allowed to feel old? I'm still a university student, I still am not quite financially independent, and I still haven't found love. I feel like these things are ones that come with time, and I probably haven't been alive long enough for that time to happen.

That being said, being 21 years old means a lot of things. It means I haven't been a teenager for 2 years, for instance. It also means I can drink anywhere in the world... which isn't a huge bonus, frankly, but I'll take it. It means I'm hurtling into my fourth year of university in a few months, and it means that I should really think a bit harder about what I'm going to be doing with the rest of my life--the beta test is over, and now I gotta start power leveling.

That being said, I've done a lot of stuff to that end. I've just planned out some work for the summer months, and I'm also looking to join [IATSE58](https://www.iatse58.org) to get a head start on my hopefully-an-audio-engineer-but-theatre-tech-works-too career. I'm also taking slightly better care of myself--with the notable exception of last week, as Sunday in the Park with George just wrapped up--and I'm feeling pretty damn good about life right now. I've got some awesome friends, I'm fairly healthy, and I feel like I know what I'm doing, as well as where I'm going.

I love my friends so, so much. Like, wow. Friends are great <3

Moving forward, I think I really ought to cement in a real sleep schedule or a fixed wakeup time. Waking up this morning was not pleasant, and I hope that doesn't carry into the rest of the day. I also need to start working a bit harder and saving some money up, regardless of where life takes me. Perhaps also start posting soon?! But those are concerns for another day; it's time to write two essays and run to class!
