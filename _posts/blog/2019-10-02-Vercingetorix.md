Well, midterm season is rolling around again. In the wake of recent events at UofT, I think it's all the more important to be mindful of everyone around us through this incredibly hectic time of year.

To that end, I think I'll make an effort to reach out to & check in with all of the lovely folx I've had the pleasure of meeting, working with, and being friends with during my time here. I know I always appreciate it when one of my friends is willing to sit down and lend an open ear for me, so I'd like to extend that same courtesy to everyone around me as well.

As for myself, I'll probably keep up my effort of going to the gym at least 3x a week. I'd like to continue doing some heavier work, but I'll have to make sure I adjust my diet to compensate.

I'm also going to have to start scheduling in days to take care of myself and relax. I've been feeling a little burnt out over the past week or so, probably because I haven't been designating any time for relaxation.

The Germans have a nice term for this:_"Ruhe und Entspannung,"_ which translates to something like "relaxation and tranquility." Here's hoping everyone finds a bit of time for that, because heaven knows we all need some.
