I have a great many ideas as to what I should like to write about on this blog. For instance, I'd like to write a bit about my interests and hobbies: fountain pens, coffee, film photography, and tech. I'd also like to keep a regular log of my travels, as well as a fairly up-to-date column about my musical endevaours and changing musical tastes.

However, I don't quite know where to start.

Just as the hardest part about starting this blog wasn't actually learning HTML and CSS, but rather getting off my behind and diving right into it; the hardest part about blogging right now is figuring out what to start writing about.

I have been contemplating writing about Front of House (FOH) engineer practice with regards to micing and mixing, and compiling some resources that explain the very basics of input-output theory for use in non-demanding environments. This, of course, is a direct result of my insane amount of immersion in the student theatre community at U of T, but it also stems from my earnest desire to make "tech" work feel less inaccessible to everyone involved in any sort of production.

Additionally, I've wanted to start creating guides for some of the more complex games I play. However, my guide-writing experience is highly limited... which got me thinking of bringing in one or two co-authors. Of course, I don't expect a massive amount of traffic--heck, I expect no traffic at all--but I still think it'd be worth consulting a writer friend for a review of campus theatre, or a gamer friend for detailed build contributions.

I will keep this post updated as my train of thought continues to chug along into the night.
