Just a RIP post for my beloved bike, Mikey II.

Stolen from Victoria College on May 19th of 2018, while I was visiting a friend in Maryland for a couple of days :( Obviously, the chances of him being stolen were exacerbated by how long I left him there, but I didn't have access to my condo's bike storage yet...

Anyway, I really do think cycling is the best way to get around the city. I've been cycling through Toronto since first year--first on a Giant hybrid, then on a Gallant three speed. I tend to only use my bike when the weather is nice and I don't need my lights, but what I really enjoy most is racing around Toronto after midnight with no particular destination in mind. Traffic is dead, the lights are always green, and the only company I have is the sound of wind whistling past my ears.

I'm often surprised by how many people are crammed onto certain TTC routes when the weather is favourable for cycling. The 501 Queen streetcar is my favourite example--it's perpetually late, always overcrowded, and most any cyclist can outpace it in seconds. When I'm planning to bike anywhere downtown Toronto, I just ask Google Maps how long it takes to drive there; the times are almost always accurate, since I'm a strong cyclist and cars are so slow here!

On that note, both Mikey and Mikey II have saved my skin on a number of occasions. Most recently, I woke up late for an exam at the Faculty of Music, and the TTC was hella delayed. No problem, though; I hopped on the bike, saved myself an Uber fare, and got there just as quick.

As you can probably tell, I'm a huge fan of cycling, and so I intend to invest in a new bike friend in the coming months. Money is a bit tight these days, but I think the cost savings and happiness gain is well worth the investment!
