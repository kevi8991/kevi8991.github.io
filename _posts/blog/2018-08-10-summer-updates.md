WOW I have not posted in a while!! Hello world!!!

First off, in no particular order, some life updates:

- Haven't figured out what to name my new [bike](/blog/a-new-friend/) yet, but Pinkie is in consideration
- Scored a slot in the [TCDS](https://www.facebook.com/trinitycollegedramaticsociety/) season with the lovely and fantastically talented [Rebecca Lefranc](https://www.facebook.com/rebecca.lefranc.9); we're producing [If/Then](https://www.mtishows.com/ifthen) in March
- I was re-elected as the Technical Director of [The Cat's Eye](https://thecatseye.ca), and I'm overhauling parts of the lighting grid AND the entire sound system this summer--stay tuned for some posts in [Audio](/audio/) c:
- I was also elected Co-President of [VicXposure](http://vicxposure.ca), along with [Aloysius Wong](https://www.facebook.com/aloysius.wong.311)--looking forward to revamping the website, running events, and ordering in new gear for next year. I'll also be shooting pretty much any and all [Scarlet & Gold](https://www.facebook.com/alexa.ballis) events, so this'll be my first Highball
- Working with a few friends--[Nam Nguyen](https://www.facebook.com/nam.nguyen.545) of [A Perfect Bowl of Pho](http://paprikafestival.com/festival-2018/perfectpho/) fame and [Cy Macikunas](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009293827815), among others--to establish Hotake. We're aiming to produce and facilitate the development of theatrical and musical works led by artists who identify with the Asian and Pacific Islander diaspora, with the aim of advancing API representation in these art forms at UofT
- Speaking of work; I've been working long days at Vancouver Island Shingle, grading and packing cedar shakes. Hard work, but an immense amount of income. Gotta pay those student loans :<

Moving forward, I really hope I can start this year off on the right foot, as both 2nd and 3rd year started off a bit... weird? I was both overcommitted to things and not taking care of myself, so that'll hopefully not be happening this year. Additionally, I'm going to be checking some things off my to-do list before the year even begins, such as:

- Getting my G1 before the summer is out (can you believe I haven't gotten my G1 yet?!)
- Updating some of my EDC items, like:
  - My portable audio setup
    - Currently Spotify -> the headphone jack on my S7 Edge -> Shure SE215
    - Might get [The International](https://www.headfonia.com/alo-international/) by [Alo Audio](https://www.aloaudio.com) and a DAP
  - My cellphone
    - Options include the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, the iPhone X, and the LG V40
  - My wallet
    - Currently the [Slim Wallet](http://www.ateleia.com/shop/wallet?category=Leather+Goods); doesn't hold quite enough anymore
    - Maybe a bifold?
- Fixing my wardrobe
  - Really gotta get some collared shirts in there, as well as some new cardigans
  - I don't own a single pair of jeans; currently eyeing the [N&F Ichiban Selvage Denim](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/massdrop-x-naked-famous-ichiban-selvage-denim)
  - Also might get rid of all my cotton T-Shirts and replace them with cashmere and/or merino
- Finding a job
  - [Black Bear Espresso](https://www.blackbearespresso.com), please hire meee
  - Though TBH I don't really know that I'd be able to work while maintaining the rest of my responsibilities
