So I'm finally done third year!!! For those who don't know me outside of Vic or musical theatre, I'm studying piano at the Faculty of Music with a German studies major on the side. Needless to say, this school year was A Time.

I started off the year thinking that I wouldn't do as much theatrical work as I'd done in previous years, but I ended up working on more shows this past year than the previous two years combined--definitely something I'll have to avoid doing next year! I also traveled a bunch, made a ton of new friends, practiced my photography, started this blog, and proposed a show; I'd say it was a fairly successful year.

Some things to work on probably include my time management--as usual, I can't say no to things, and that often is a detriment to my sleep schedule and general well-being. I also need to start eating more regularly, because apparently pooping once a week is abnormal...?

Summer goals include fixing up my laptop, traveling a bunch, cycling or working out on a daily basis, and learning a bunch of repertoire for next year! I'm really excited about my upcoming trip to Maryland--visiting an internet friend--and getting started on the Brahms Piano Trio No.3, which I didn't have time to see through to completion this year.

I'm also hoping to find time to start writing in that audio section of the blog! Having been a part of pretty much every musical on campus this year, I feel like I've got a lot of material to work from. Maybe I'll start a photography section as well? Who knows? I don't think I have enough all-photo posts just yet, but if that changes anytime soon I might add an extra category.

Think that's about it for now! Might update this as things progress over the summer.

Made it to Maryland in one piece despite missing my flight!

I might have pinkeye? I've never had pinkeye before, but I guess it's pretty common after flying.
