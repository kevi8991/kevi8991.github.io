As it turns out, editing text files on GitHub is far from the best way to create a website. Fortunately, [Tanuj][fb] has been walking me through some basic Git commands, as well as introducing me to [Sublime Text][st] for the editing of my posts :)

Following this, I'm hoping to figure out how to locally develop the site so I don't have to tether my phone to my laptop for consistent connection...
