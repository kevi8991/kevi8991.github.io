As it turns out, editing text files on GitHub is far from the best way to create a website. Fortunately, [Tanuj][fb] has been walking me through some basic Git commands, as well as introducing me to [Sublime Text][st] for the editing of my posts :)

Following this, I'm hoping to figure out how to locally develop the site so I don't have to tether my phone to my laptop for consistent connection...

Ruby is being a total pain and can't find any of its dependencies. I've found a workaround that allows me to view the site locally, but all of the Jekyll gems are glitching out.

The one I hoped would be my saving grace, [Thomas Jean Lynch][tfb], has confirmed that they do not use Ruby and cannot offer me any assistance. I continue to bob along in the ocean, aimlessly and helplessly.
