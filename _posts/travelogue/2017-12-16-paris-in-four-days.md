I spent reading week this year in lovely Paris, for a whole four days! Pretty exciting, I know. I make an effort to take a trip out of the city every chance I get, even if the break is only a few days long, and so I enthusiastically agreed to accompany my friend [Andrew](https://www.facebook.com/andrew.hoang.39) on a Parisian adventure he'd been planning for a while. Since I decided to tag along several weeks after he had already booked his flight, we had to hunt each other down in CDG after our respective flights arrived, but we somehow figured it out and went on our way.

## Day One

First order of business was the Airbnb. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, but our host was apparently away on business or something... so she sent her cousin to let us in and accept the payment. Of course, this became a whole ordeal since neither of us had data, but we found some Wifi and made it work.

We visited the Catacombs in the evening after dropping off our stuff, and boy was it spooky down there! If I recall correctly, the bones of about six million people in graveyards across Paris were dug up and relocated into the old limestone quarries beneath the city throughout the 16th century, as graves within the city were dangerously over capacity.

Just goes to show how inefficient traditional burials were and/or are, I suppose. Anyway, we grabbed dinner at [Le Hibou](http://lehibouparis.fr/en/services) on the way back to the Airbnb, and called it a night.

## Day Two

The second day of our trip was very much the day we embraced the joys of being a tourist. We took a lovely stroll down the Seine, snapping more than our fair share of photos along the way.

We elected to climb the stairs up to the second platform of the Eiffel Tower before taking the elevator the rest of the way up--I don't think those stairs are open to the public anyway--and Andrew was _not_ having it. Maybe this is why I've been affectionately dubbed "Star Climber 3000" in a group chat with my first year mates?

Anyway, the view from the top was absolutely stunning; the Eiffel Tower is the tallest building in all of Paris, and it's surrounded by a bunch of low-rises, so the effect is further pronounced. I swapped to colour slide film on the way up.

Following a lovely lunch at [Chez Ming](http://www.chezming.fr), we made our way over to the [Palais de Tokyo](http://www.palaisdetokyo.com/en) and promptly fell asleep on the couches outside the gift shop--we'd probably slept about five hours over the past three days.
