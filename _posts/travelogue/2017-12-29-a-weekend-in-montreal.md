Believe it or not, I actually went on _two_ trips over reading week--I spent the weekend before the Paris adventure in chilly, charming Montreal! With the ever-fantastic [Patrick Mossman](https://www.facebook.com/patrick.mossman)!! Here's a handful of #aesthetic snaps :)

We had this brilliant plan to go on a library tour on Sunday--our first and final full day in the city--but we elected to sleep in and spend the afternoon at the [Montreal Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/). I left my camera at the coat check tho.

Following the unexpectedly long (5 hours!!) adventure at the museum, we took a bit of a nap before hitting the streets for shopping!

We didn't end up finding anything of interest, though, and were feeling peckish. Fortunately, we had made a reservation at [Gyu-Kaku](http://www.gyu-kaku.com/montreal/) the night before, so we had a fantastic dinner there before heading home to pack for the trip home.

That about concludes our weekend adventure in Montreal! We didn't go clubbing on the last night due to food coma, but it was still a lovely time.

Coming up next: my Hong Kong trip photos!!!
